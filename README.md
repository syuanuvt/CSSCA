# CSSCA
cluster-wise sparse simultaneous component analysis: inlcuding the non-sparse version of the cluster-wise simultaneous component analysis as the special case

## Initial Set-up
**function package**: including the package that is required to loaded, and the functions that serve as the basic functions for the CSSCA analysis

## CSCA: the non-sparse version of the cluster-wise sparse simultaneous component analysis
**SCA common:** (non-sparse version of) simultaneous component analysis for linked data. Fast SVD algorithm is used to compute the solutions, therefore 
**SCA common:**
